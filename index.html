                Welcome to Mickey Dee's <br>
                Our family friendly restaurant was created by two founders: Mickey Donaldson and Dee's McKay.<br>
                The two were both starving on the streets of Ohio, and they found eachother wandering the streets. Combined, they had enough money to buy an abandoned building. <br>
                After 20 years of hard struggles, they finished the building.<br>
                They grew all the food the restaurants needed <br>
                It gave their food a unique tasting flavor, and their restaurant became one of the most famous in the world! <br>
